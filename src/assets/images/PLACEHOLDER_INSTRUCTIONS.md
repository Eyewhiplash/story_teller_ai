# Placeholder Image Instructions

To fully utilize the custom image feature in Story-Teller-AI, follow these steps to create placeholder images:

## Creating Placeholder Images

1. You need to create at least the following placeholder images:

   - `stories/default-story.png`: Default image for stories
   - `elements/default-character.png`: Default image for characters
   - `elements/default-setting.png`: Default image for settings
   - `elements/default-theme.png`: Default image for themes

2. You can create these images using any image editing software:
   - Size recommendation: 300x200 pixels
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - Content: Child-friendly images that represent stories/characters/settings/themes

3. Simple placeholder image options:
   - Use free stock images (ensure they're properly licensed)
   - Create simple illustrations
   - Use icons with text labels
   - Screenshots from children's books (if properly licensed)

## Testing Without Images

Until you create your custom images, the application will:
1. Try to load the specific image
2. Fall back to the default image for that category
3. If no default image exists, show a text emoji
